        I am a Full-Stack Developer, with a strong focus on Frontend Development
        and Java. I specialize in developing MERN applications and I'm currently
        pursuing Bachelor of Engineering (B.E) in Computer Science & Engineering
        from VCET. I work persistently, with self-discipline and commitment, to
        enhance my skills. In addition to coding, I enjoy building side projects
        and contributing to open-source projects because it allows me to explore
        my creativity and accomplish exciting tasks.
